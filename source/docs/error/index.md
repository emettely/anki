If you're new to programming, let me explain. I previously used [Power Format Pack](https://gitlab.com/neftas/supplementary-buttons-anki/issues/96), [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com), [Moustache](https://mustache.github.io) and [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) — all of which are great, until ...

2. One just doesn't work with Anki.
3. It happens _all the time_ in tech.
