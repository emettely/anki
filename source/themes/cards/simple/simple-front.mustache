<!-- Simple card: front
     ==================

    - Type: What's the answer?
    - Docs: https://github.com/badlydrawnrob/anki/tree/master/source/docs/simple/index.md
    - Key:  ★ Required
            ☆ Optional (recommended)
            ✎ Optional (notes, markdown)
            ⤷ Field Type

    We try to keep all cards similar(ish), so most
    elements are shared between each card, but some
    sections apply to only one card. We use a bit of
    a hybrid between ECSS naming conventions and
    GPS global, section, page elements.

    See `data-simple.md` for the data you'll use to
    populate the Anki form fields, which you can use
    with Pandoc to compile your data fields.
    See `source/docs/professional/index.md` for info.
