## ✎ Markdown

Generate with Pandoc. Add the resulting code to `★ Key point (code block or image)`, making sure to add the cloze fields that you need (for instance, all of the commented answers below). You'll need to `Toggle HTML Editor ⌘⇧X` (`‹›`) and add your cloze fields in the rich text preview.

```python
[0, 20] # >= 0, <= 20

(0, 20] # > 0, <= 20

(0, 20) # > 0, < 20

[0, 20) # >= 0, < 20
```
