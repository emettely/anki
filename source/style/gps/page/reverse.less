// Back of card ================================================================
// We're only naming this as `reverse` because of the natural file order
// (naming the files `back` would appear before `front` when browsing files.
//
// #1: Requires an `#answer` ID on reveal to skip to the right part of the card.
//
// #2: When two `pre` blocks are on top of each other, the first one should have
//     no margin (mainly with Simple card type).

#reverse {
  // #1
  #answer {
    pre {
      margin-bottom: 0  // #2
    }
  }
}
